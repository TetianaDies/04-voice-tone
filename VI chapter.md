# Be or not to beâ€¦
Many people believe that designers are unique in their thinking and working on projects like special in some way. Becoming a designer actually takes years of hard work, experimentation, and failure. Designers, like everyone else, should be inspired by something for their work, and then the problem appears: to be inspired or to copy or not to be...

The very famous web site Pinterest has brought an opportunity to look at the best works of designers. There is a lot of competition between designers who look at their work and want to be even better. How to be better when everything is already invented for us?

Before doing something, we always look at what has already been done before us. We can borrow an idea but not an exact copy of the design. 

# Bad copy is fun
When I started to work like designer, I also try to copy some art, to learn some new style. For example, at the university we had a task to copy the works of one famous artist to understand how he used color, shadows, contrast in his works.

 As you can see in the example, it was difficult for me to make a copy. A bad copy is even more fun than the original.
*It is very important to talk about a copy as a copy not as your own work!

# Good copy is stolen work

There are many examples of stolen artwork not only in graphic design but also in fashion, interiors, films, and so on.
